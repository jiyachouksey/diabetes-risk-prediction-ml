# 🩺 Diabetes Risk Prediction using Machine Learning

A supervised machine learning project developed to predict diabetes risk using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. The pipeline includes comprehensive data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization. This project aims to support early diagnosis and prevention efforts through data-driven healthcare analytics.
